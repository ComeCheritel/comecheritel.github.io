excerpt: 'The purpose of this abstract and presentation is to present a compact climate module that can be used to make certain IAMs more accurate and relevant. This climate module is calibrated in a Bayesian manner and thus makes it possible to highlight the impact of uncertainty for robust decision making.'

The purpose of this abstract and presentation is to present a compact climate module that can be used to make certain IAMs more accurate and relevant. This climate module is calibrated in a Bayesian manner and thus makes it possible to highlight the impact of uncertainty for robust decision making.
